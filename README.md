# GlobalGameJam2019
Entity Game.

My submission for the global game jam 2019!

The premise of the jam was "What does home mean to you". I decided put my own twist on the theme, by centring the game around a celestial, seemingly ancient creature.

The Entity itself is only seen (outside his spaceship) in the intro screen of the game. Once in the game, the player controls their spaceship,
sucking all life energy out of any planet they can find. The Entity believes he will gain pleasure from this, inflicting his own personal demons
and torture upon the Universe. But does this satisfy them in end? Who knows if that answer will ever come?(Because the game is unfinished)
